# ABOUT SUBMISSION -- FINISH
## Intro
Spook-tacular Events is a Halloween events website that helps users find fun activities happening near them (in Ireland) during the Halloween season. The Events page allows users to search for a wide range of Halloween-themed activities for participants of all age groups. Businesses are invited to start a partnership by advertising their wares, like Halloween-related products or events in the community neighbors can take part in.
Finally, the Gallery page illustrates various Halloween activities, snacks and decor of the season. Clicking each image enlarges it and gives the image description.

## Goal -- FINISH
The goal section provides a concise summary of the main objective or purpose of the project or software described in this README. It addresses the following aspects:

- ➡️ Problem Statement
- ➡️ Objective(s)
- ➡️ Target Audience
- ➡️ Benefits

## Design

The website was designed in a simple paragraph layout, which was intended to make it easier for the user to navigate. Each page contains a banner with a transition element, a custom logo, navigation bar and footer. 

### Color Scheme
The color scheme was chosen to reflect the 'Halloween' theme but maintain readability and high contrast.

The background of all site pages is the lightest orange color, reflecting the popular color of the Halloween season. This contrasts well with the brighter orange, used for some cards, the teal color used for the navbar, footer and some card backgrounds, and the dark purple and burgundy colors to accent important information.

All combinations of the colors used illustrate a contrast between background and text to ensure maximum user accessibility.

### Fonts
The group decided on three fonts to use for this project. 'Creepster' was used as the main font for titles and generally larger text as it, in our opinion, looked like it would fit well with the Halloween theme. 

The other two fonts, 'Montserrat' and 'Lato' were used to ensure text was easily readible and clearly visible to users.
